# iOS_Test_GenerateBarcode
Read a barcode from a card and generate a new one full screen

This project uses a free barcode library I found here:
https://github.com/netshade/Cocoa-Touch-Barcodes

The app reads a barcode using the AVFoundation elements that already come with iOS, and then uses the Netshade
library to generate a new code.

I currently only have a handful of barcodes to test so it is possible that some types of barcodes are incorrect.
This is just a test and sample anyways.
